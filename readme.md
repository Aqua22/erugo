erugo is a **self-hosted WeTransfer alternative** written in **Go**, with a **Vue.js** frontend. It provides a seamless file-sharing experience that is both secure and user-friendly. Designed to be easy to deploy and use, erugo runs from a **single binary** containing both the backend and frontend.

- **Authorization for Creating Shares** - Only authorized users can create shares, but anyone with a share URL can download.
- **SQLite for Storage** - Uses SQLite to store share metadata for simplicity and efficiency.
- **Configurable Storage & Limits** - Customize storage path and max share size to suit your needs.
- **Interactive First-Run Setup** - Guides you through creating the first user account using **Bubble Tea**.
- **Modern UI** - Provides a sleek and user-friendly web interface.
- **Fully Open-Source & White-Label Ready** - Customize the branding and modify the code as needed.
